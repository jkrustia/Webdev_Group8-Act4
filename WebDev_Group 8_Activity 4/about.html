                    Namnam was born from a heartfelt desire to honor Filipino cuisine and introduce its rich culinary heritage to the world. Founded by Kamilah Reyes in 2025, Namnam started as a small, family-inspired restaurant with a deep commitment to showcasing the authentic flavors of the Philippines. Growing up in a household where food was central to every celebration, Kamilah developed a profound appreciation for the unique stories behind each Filipino dish. This passion, combined with her culinary training, sparked the idea of creating a space where traditional recipes could meet modern creativity.
